# Shared Globals

This folder stores root-level shared constants/text intended to stay consistent
across:

- `backend/`
- `frontend/`
- `macos_app/`
- `agent/` docs/help text

Current shared file:

- `app_text.yml`

When changing product copy, update this folder first, then sync app-specific
constants where needed.
